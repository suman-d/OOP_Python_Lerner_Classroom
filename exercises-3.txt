(1) Modify the Bowl class, such that adding a new scoop to the bowl
    will only work if you have fewer than 3 scoops.  In other words: max 3
    scoops per bowl.

    Adding a new scoop to a bowl that is already full will be silently
    ignored.

(2) Create a Loan class. Each time someone creates a new Loan, it's
    for a certain amount of money.  That money is taken from the
    bank's available assets.

    l1 = Loan(500)
    l2 = Loan(200)
    l3 = Loan(700)  # raises an exception -- ValueError to indicate no money
    l1.repay(500)
    l3 = Loan(700)  # now it'll work, because the bank has sufficient funds
